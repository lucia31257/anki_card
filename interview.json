        "answer": "A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with the user, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A database is a structured collection of data.\nA DBMS allows a user to interact with the database. The data stored in the database can be modified, retrieved and deleted and can be of any type like strings, numbers, images, etc.\nThere are two types of DBMS;\nRelational Database Management System; The data is stored in relations (tables). Example – MySQL.\nNon-Relational Database Management System; There is no concept of relations, tuples and attributes. Example – MongoDB\nLet’s move to the next question in this SQL Interview Questions."

        "question": "What is RDBMS; How is it different from DBMS;",
        "answer": "A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a set of applications and features that allow IT professionals and others to develop, edit, administer, and interact with relational databases. Most commercial relational database management systems use Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, which is stored in the form of tables.\nThe RDBMS is the most widely used database system in businesses all over the world. It offers a stable means of storing and retrieving massive amounts of data.\nDatabases, in general, hold collections of data that may be accessed and used in other applications. The development, administration, and use of database platforms are all supported by a database management system.\nA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure that links related data components. An RDBMS contains functions that ensure the data’s security, accuracy, integrity, and consistency. This is not the same as the file storage utilized by a database management system.\nThe following are some further distinctions between database management systems and relational database management systems;\nThe number of users who are permitted to utilise the system\nA DBMS can only handle one user at a time, whereas an RDBMS can handle numerous users.\nHardware and software specifications\nIn comparison to an RDBMS, a DBMS requires fewer software and hardware.\nAmount of information\nRDBMSes can handle any quantity of data, from tiny to enormous, whereas DBMSes are limited to small amounts.\nThe structure of the database\nData is stored in a hierarchical format in a DBMS, whereas an RDBMS uses a table with headers that serve as column names and rows that hold the associated values. Implementation of the ACID principle\n\nThe atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) concept is not used by DBMSs for data storage. RDBMSes, on the other hand, use the ACID model to organize their data and assure consistency.\nDatabases that are distributed\nA DBMS will not provide complete support for distributed databases, whereas an RDBMS will.\nPrograms that are managed\nA DBMS focuses on keeping databases that are present within the computer network and system hard discs, whereas an RDBMS helps manage relationships between its incorporated tables of data.\nNormalization of databases is supported\nA RDBMS can be normalized , but a DBMS cannot be normalized."

Each consecutive normal form depends on the previous one.The first three normal forms are usually adequate.\nNormal Forms are used in database tables to remove or decrease duplication. The following are the many forms;\nFirst Normal Form;\nWhen every attribute in a relation is a single-valued attribute, it is said to be in first normal form. The first normal form is broken when a relation has a composite or multi-valued property.\nSecond Normal Form;\nA relation is in second normal form if it meets the first normal form’s requirements and does not contain any partial dependencies. In 2NF, a relation has no partial dependence, which means it has no non-prime attribute that is dependent on any suitable subset of any table candidate key. Often, the problem may be solved by setting a single column Primary Key.\nThird Normal Form;\nIf a relation meets the requirements for the second normal form and there is no\n\ntransitive dependency, it is said to be in the third normal form."
